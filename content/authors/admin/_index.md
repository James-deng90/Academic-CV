## About Me

Hi, I’m Xiangdeng Du, a PhD student in ecology at Sun Yat-sen University. My research focuses on plant-fungal interactions, biodiversity, and ecosystem functioning, with a particular interest in how mycorrhizal fungi shape plant community dynamics across environmental gradients. In my free time, I enjoy playing badminton, table tennis, and exploring nature.
